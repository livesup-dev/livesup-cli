To manage, monitor, control your app, teams and business you probably need to log in into 10
different services (or more!). It's even harder if you just joined the organization or
switched to a new team. LiveSup tries to add transparency to the services you use and it
creates a layer that organizes and simplifies the information you need when you need it.`,
